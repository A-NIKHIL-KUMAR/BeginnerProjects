								<br>I am a very shy person and to join WithMyselfMe gives me self confidence to express my feeling. I am a young businessman and I don't have much time but I want to spend my all free time on WithMyselfMe. We just need two factors, never give up and trust yourself. I didn't had the courage to say my name on this website because I thought "log kaya kahege" but now I have enough confidence to say my name on the website because of WithMyselfMe.

								<br>WithMyselfMe has helped me a lot during my hard times. I am a very reserved person and cant even open up to my friends when m stressed. I dont feel like troubling up my friends with my problems. And when it gets beyond my control i just come to this page and write out all my feelings..it helped me a lot and specially when people out their are so supporting and try out helping me..Today everywhere people are just spreading negativity but here its different even the broken people are helping each other in getting up and facing up their fears.

								<br>You never know the good one person can bring into your life, that is why WithMyselfMe is an incredible platform to find your support. One of the key benefits of subscribing to WithMyselfMe is the greater perceived empathy and respect that their community of peer supporters are seen to have for the individuals they support.

								<br>WithMyselfMe provides a unique platform which helps people through peer support. Claiming victory over an illness becomes easy when you have a friend to talk to, a shoulder to lean on and a heart that understands and thats what the duo is doing. I am super proud of them for this amazing initiative.

								<br>2020 has been an immensely difficult year for all of us in varying degrees but to top it off our inability to commune and share our burdens and stressors has made it more intense. Peer-to-Peer support is an initiative in the right direction. It creates an amazing platform for people to discuss issues and offload the thoughts they’re struggling most with in a safe space. Mostly we find that WE ARE NOT ALONE. In that knowledge we can be encouraged and strengthened to face tomorrow.
